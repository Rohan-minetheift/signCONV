### Step 2: Install Python Packages

**Option A: Automatic Installation (Recommended)**
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in your project folder
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   python install.py

1. **Check your project folder structure:**
   ```
   SignLanguageConverter/
   ├── sign_language_converter.py    ← Your main application
   ├── cnn8grps_rad1_model.h5       ← AI model file
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── install.py
   └── (other original files)
   ```

2. **Test your webcam:**
   - Make sure your webcam is connected
   - Close any other applications using the camera

### Step 4: Run the Application

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "Module not found" error
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install [missing_module_name]
```

### Problem: Camera not working
**Solutions:**
- Make sure webcam is connected and not used by other apps
- Try restarting the application
- Check if you have multiple cameras (the app uses camera 0 by default)

### Problem: Model file not found
**Solution:**
- Make sure `cnn8grps_rad1_model.h5` is in the same folder as your Python file
- Re-copy the file from your original dataset

### Problem: Poor detection accuracy
**Solutions:**
- Improve lighting conditions
- Use a plain background behind your hand
- Make clear, distinct gestures
- Hold gestures steady for 1-2 seconds

### Problem: Speech not working
**Solutions:**
